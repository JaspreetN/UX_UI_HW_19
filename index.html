                        Hi, I'm Jaspreet!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Transitioning from a premedical background, I discovered my passion for UX design as a way to channel my creativity and problem-solving skills into a more dynamic and user-focused field.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My journey from the sciences to design reflects my commitment to exploring diverse disciples and finding a path where empathy, innovation, and user-centric thinking converge. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, armed with a unique blend of analytical thinking and creative flair, I am dedicated to crafting seamless digital experiences that prioritize the human element in technology.
